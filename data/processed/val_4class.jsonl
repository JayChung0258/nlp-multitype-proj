It faces a cash shortage after failing to persuade key lenders to reschedule debt under a new restructuring plan. Shares of Hanjin remain suspended in Seoul after plunging by as much as 29% on Tuesday. Hanjin, which is also the world's seventh-largest container line, has been unprofitable for four of the last five years. Hanjin may get some financial relief courtesy of rival Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM). Shares of HMM jumped by as much as 22% after Korea's financial regulator said the firm may buy some of Hanjin's assets. However HMM hasn't been spared from the woes bedevilling the sector. It recently announced a reorganisation plan too. South Korea's shipping and shipbuilding industry is one of the hardest-hit by a prolonged downturn in global trade. A drop in orders has led to overcapacity and depressed freight rates, as well as an increase in debts. \"Korean shipping companies have suffered large losses largely because charter rates on leased vessels were fixed in 2010 at a high level while actual shipping rates have fallen,\" Nomura analyst Young Sun Kwon said. The South Korean government is now looking to undertake a painful reorganisation of the entire industry, which will require major retrenchments. The ongoing restructuring is one of several reasons why we expect growth to be weak this year and next, Krystal Tan from Capital Economics said. \"The loss of tens of thousands of jobs certainly won't help economic sentiment,\" she added. \"But it is a relatively small number when set against the 26m people in employment in Korea so we're not likely to see a big spike in the unemployment rate.\"", "label": "T1", "label_id": 0, "text_len_char": 1732, "text_len_word": 287}

It faces a cash shortage after failing to persuade key lenders to reschedule debt under a new restructuring plan . Shares of Hanjin remain suspended in Seoul after plunging by as much as 29 % on Tuesday . Hanjin , which is also the world seventh-largest container shipping line, said it has filed for court receivership after its banks withdrew support. The South Korean company's move, following Korea Development Bank's (KDB) decision to halt financial aid, deals a severe blow to global trade, potentially leaving billions of dollars worth of goods stranded. This could become the largest container shipping bankruptcy, disrupting supply chains globally before the peak shopping season. Already, U.S. and Chinese ports refuse Hanjin ships entry, and some vessels have been seized by creditors. The South Korean government has voiced deep concern, urging domestic rivals like Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM) to consider taking over some of Hanjin's routes, vessels, and personnel. Financial regulators in Seoul are coordinating efforts to mitigate economic fallout. Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM), itself recently restructured, has expressed readiness to cooperate with government plans to stabilize the market. This might involve acquiring Hanjin’s healthy assets, such as port terminals or select ships, to ensure service continuity. Details are pending court proceedings in Seoul. Creditors, led by KDB, found Hanjin's self-rescue proposals insufficient by the September 4 deadline, leading to negotiation collapse. This signals Hanjin Shipping's likely end, prompting significant reshuffling in global shipping alliances as other major carriers absorb its market share. The incident highlights severe challenges facing the broader shipping sector, long struggling with overcapacity and weak demand. Focus is now on the Seoul court's actions and swift asset transfer to operators like Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM) to limit widespread disruption.", "label": "T2", "label_id": 1, "text_len_char": 2063, "text_len_word": 308}

South Korea's shipping and shipbuilding industries are among those most severely impacted by a prolonged global trade downturn. A decline in orders has resulted in overcapacity, suppressed freight rates, and an escalation of debts. Nomura analyst Young Sun Kwon explained that Korean shipping companies have suffered substantial losses primarily because charter rates for leased vessels were fixed at high levels in 2010, while actual shipping rates have subsequently fallen. The South Korean government is now preparing to implement a difficult, industry-wide restructuring, which will necessitate significant job cuts. Krystal Tan from Capital Economics stated that this ongoing restructuring is one reason why weak economic growth is anticipated this year and next.

Despite safety declining since 2013, Mr Clarke described it as a \"mixed picture of progress\".

Despite safety declining since 2013 , Mr Clarke described it as a \" mixed picture of progress throughout the prison estate. While some institutions demonstrated resilience and effective leadership, Peter Clarke's report highlighted a persistent struggle with systemic issues that continued to undermine the safe and effective operation of many establishments across England and Wales. The surge in violence, often linked directly to the ready availability of illicit drugs like spice, placed immense strain on both resources and the morale of dedicated staff. A significant challenge identified by Clarke was the ongoing problem of staff retention. This issue, exacerbated by the demanding and often dangerous work environment, meant that many prisons struggled to deliver a full daily regime, leading to extended periods of lock-up for prisoners. Such reduced out-of-cell time often fueled frustration and further escalated tensions within already volatile environments. Crucially, the report by Clarke also drew attention to the critical issue of prison capacity. Many establishments were operating significantly above their certified normal accommodation. This widespread overcrowding, where cells designed for a single inmate were frequently housing two or even three, directly contributed to the documented decline in safety and the notable increase in violent incidents. It severely limited personal space, heightened friction between inmates, and made effective supervision considerably more difficult for staff. Peter Clarke underscored the urgent need for sustained investment, not just in the physical infrastructure of prisons, but vitally in the recruitment, retention, and well-being of frontline staff. He emphasized that prioritizing the mental and physical health of both prisoners and staff was essential for creating environments truly conducive to rehabilitation, rather than merely containment. The Chief Inspector warned that without tackling these deep-seated structural issues, including the fundamental mismatch between the rising prison population and the available certified normal accommodation, the risk of further deterioration in safety and order within the nation's prisons remained unacceptably high. His findings provided a sobering assessment, urging the government to adopt a comprehensive and strategic approach to adequately resource and manage the future integrity of the entire prison system.", "label": "T2", "label_id": 1, "text_len_char": 2786, "text_len_word": 397}

However, inspectors also observed positive interactions between staff and prisoners, alongside a diverse array of training and educational opportunities. Although safety levels had worsened since 2013, Mr. Clarke characterized the situation as a complex blend of advancements and setbacks. During the July and August inspections, the prison held 770 inmates, significantly exceeding its Certified Normal Accommodation (CNA) capacity of 532, which indicates the number of prisoners that can be safely and humanely housed.

His pace in the opening stages clearly demonstrated his intent to build on the momentum gained from Mexico, where a last-gasp surge saw him snatch victory. The Tour de Course, often dubbed the 'Rally of 10,000 Corners', provides a stark contrast to the gravel and altitude of Mexico, demanding pinpoint accuracy and supreme confidence on high-speed tarmac. Meeke, driving his Citroen C3 WRC, seemed perfectly attuned to the demanding conditions, pushing hard from the very first kilometre. His ability to find an extra gear on the demanding Corsican roads left his rivals, especially championship leader Ogier, with little room for error. Ogier, ever the strategist, was playing a waiting game, conserving tyres and monitoring Meeke's incredible rhythm, knowing that any mistake on these narrow, tree-lined roads could be catastrophic. The battle between the two titans was shaping up to be a classic, with Meeke not just fighting for a win but for validation after a mixed start to the season. His victory in Mexico had silenced some critics, but a strong result here in the Tour de Course would solidify his position as a genuine title contender.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Russia's bosses have gone from the most confident to the least, due to problems caused by sanctions and the falling oil price. In the UK, concern had risen sharply about the availability of talent. The number of chief executives concerned about the skills gap rose from 64% last year to 84% this year. That is considerably higher than in Germany, France or Spain. This was partly put down to the high level of employment in the UK, which means that there is a smaller pool of workers to choose from, and partly due to concerns about the education system. On a global level, the biggest worries that chief executives have are geo-political uncertainties, over-regulation and cyber security. The report, which was launched at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, said that \"concerns about cyber threats have shot up most compared to last year - and in light of the recent attacks on gaming and entertainment networks, the perceived risk will only increase\". Dennis Nally, chairman of PwC said: \"CEO confidence is down notably in oil-producing nations around the world as a result of plummeting crude oil prices. Russia CEOs, for example, were the most confident in last year's survey, but are the least confident this year. \"Confidence has also slipped among CEOs in the Middle East, Venezuela, and Nigeria,\" he said. He also pointed out that there appeared to a shift in confidence from emerging market to western markets. Chief executives ranked the US as their most important market for growth over the next year, putting it ahead of China for the first time in the five years that the question has been asked.

Perhaps unsurprisingly , Russia 's bosses have gone from the most confident to the least , due to problems caused by sanctions and the falling oil price . In the UK , concern had risen sharply about the availability of talent . The number of chief executives concerned about the availability of key skills had risen sharply. This growing talent crunch in the UK, as revealed by the PwC survey, is seen as a significant threat to growth and competitiveness. Many UK businesses report struggling to find and retain staff with essential digital and technical competencies, leading to increased investment in upskilling existing workforces and a focus on attracting international talent where possible. In contrast to the UK's talent focus, business leaders in Germany and France voiced different primary concerns. German CEOs, while relatively more optimistic than their French counterparts, were predominantly worried about global demand slowdowns and geopolitical instability impacting their export-heavy industries. The eurozone's tepid recovery also cast a shadow, with concerns over deflation and consumer spending remaining high. In France, chief executives were more preoccupied with domestic regulatory burdens and the need for structural reforms to stimulate economic activity. Confidence levels remained subdued across both nations, reflecting a cautious European outlook amidst ongoing economic uncertainties and the lingering effects of the debt crisis. Globally, the PwC survey of over 1,300 CEOs highlighted a universal shift towards caution. Beyond Russia's unique challenges stemming from sanctions and falling oil prices, and the UK's specific talent woes, the overall sentiment was one of strategic retrenchment. Only 37% of chief executives globally expected economic improvement, down from 44%. This marked decline underscores a pervasive sense of uncertainty across various regions, influenced by factors ranging from commodity price volatility to geopolitical tensions. CEOs indicated a greater focus on operational efficiency, cost control, and organic growth strategies, with less appetite for aggressive expansion. Investment in innovation, particularly digital technologies, emerged as a key priority to build resilience and secure competitive advantage in a volatile global market.", "label": "T2", "label_id": 1, "text_len_char": 2415, "text_len_word": 357}

In the United Kingdom, there has been a significant increase in apprehension regarding talent availability. The percentage of CEOs in the UK worried about skill shortages jumped from 64% last year to 84% this year, a rate significantly exceeding that in Germany, France, or Spain. This escalating concern is partly attributed to the UK's high employment rates, which reduce the available talent pool, and partly to worries about the quality of the education system. Globally, the primary concerns for chief executives include geopolitical instability, excessive regulation, and cyber security threats. The report, unveiled at the World Economic Forum in Davos, highlighted that apprehension concerning cyber threats has risen more than any other issue since last year, noting that recent attacks on gaming and entertainment networks are expected to further elevate this perceived risk. Dennis Nally, PwC's chairman, commented that CEO confidence has significantly declined in oil-producing countries globally, primarily due to collapsing crude oil prices. He cited Russian CEOs as a prime example, shifting from being the most confident in the prior year's survey to the least confident this year. Nally added that executives in the Middle East, Venezuela, and Nigeria have also experienced a drop in confidence. Furthermore, he observed a noticeable transfer of confidence from emerging markets towards Western economies.

Human rights group Liberty said the Attorney General had given his family consent to apply to the High Court. An earlier inquest recorded a verdict of suicide on the 20-year-old soldier. The coroner at a second inquest on Pte Cheryl James, who died at Deepcut in 1995 from a single gunshot wound, recorded a verdict of suicide earlier this month. The Cheryl James inquest heard from more than 100 witnesses. Delivering his verdict, Brian Barker QC launched a scathing attack on welfare standards at Deepcut and said there was overwhelming evidence of a sexualised atmosphere there. Liberty, on behalf of Pte Benton's twin brother Tony and his sister Tracy Lewis, lodged an application with the Attorney General in July 2015 requesting that the original inquest of July 1995 be quashed and a fresh one ordered. It said that since his death, many people had stated publicly and to his family that they believed Pte Benton, from Hastings, East Sussex had been the victim of physical and psychological bullying at the barracks. \"We have been overwhelmed and disturbed by all the details of the shameful environment at Deepcut which have finally come to light through the Cheryl James inquest - it is terrible to think of Sean alone there,\" said Ms Lewis. \"More than two decades after our brother died - and having lost both our parents in recent years - Tony and I are determined to find out what happened to Sean.\" Pte Benton was the first of four young recruits to die of gunshot wounds at Deepcut between 1995 and 2002. Liberty said the initial inquest a month after his death heard evidence from six people. Pte Benton's medical and mental health records were not obtained and no evidence was sought or given concerning his experiences at the barracks. Liberty lawyer Emma Norton said if Pte Benton's death had been properly and independently investigated in 1995, decades of pain and uncertainty for the family would have been avoided.

The coroner at a second inquest on Pte Cheryl James , who died at Deepcut in 1995, concluded in 2016 that her death was not suicide but an 'unlawful killing', a landmark overturning of the original finding. Pte James was one of four young soldiers who died from gunshot wounds at the Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, in Surrey, between 1995 and 2002. The others were Private Geoff Gray, Private James Collinson, and Private Kevin Williams. All four deaths were initially ruled as suicides, leading to years of tenacious campaigning by their families, who consistently maintained that the circumstances surrounding their children's deaths were suspicious and that the original investigations were fundamentally flawed. The tragic sequence of Deepcut deaths became a national scandal, shining a harsh light on welfare provisions, alleged bullying, and the duty of care within the British Army. Families, often supported by organisations such as Liberty, fought tirelessly to have the original inquest verdicts quashed and new inquiries launched, believing that vital evidence had been overlooked or mishandled. The case of Pte Cheryl James, in particular, gained renewed traction when her parents, Des and Doreen James, secured a fresh inquest following years of arduous legal battles. This second inquest heard compelling evidence of a pervasive culture of fear, harassment, and even alleged sexual exploitation at the barracks, which her family powerfully argued contributed directly to her death. Similarly, the family of Pte Sean Benton, also found dead at the same Deepcut Barracks in Surrey, has long sought a new inquest into his death. His sister, Tracy Lewis, and other family members have consistently challenged the original suicide verdict, citing numerous inconsistencies in the evidence and a disturbing lack of proper investigation at the time. The recent consent granted by the Attorney General for Pte Benton's family to apply to the High Court for a fresh inquest underscores the profound and ongoing concerns about the integrity of the original inquiries into these tragic deaths. These landmark cases, driven by the extraordinary persistence and courage of the bereaved families and their dedicated legal teams, have had a profound and lasting impact on the understanding of military deaths and the standards of investigation within the armed forces. They have critically highlighted the urgent need for independent oversight and a transparent justice process when service personnel die in non-combat circumstances. The re-examination of these deeply troubling cases, particularly through the High Court and subsequent new inquests, represents a pivotal moment in the collective quest for truth and accountability, offering a glimmer of hope for long-awaited closure to families who have endured decades of anguish and unanswered questions regarding the deaths of their loved ones at Deepcut and similar military establishments.", "label": "T2", "label_id": 1, "text_len_char": 3272, "text_len_word": 511}

The human rights group Liberty stated that the Attorney General has granted his family permission to apply to the High Court, despite an earlier inquest having recorded a suicide verdict for the 20-year-old soldier. Earlier this month, a second inquest, examining the death of Private Cheryl James – who also died at Deepcut in 1995 from a single gunshot wound – similarly returned a suicide verdict. Over 100 witnesses testified during the Cheryl James inquiry. In his ruling, Coroner Brian Barker QC strongly criticized Deepcut's welfare provisions, citing compelling evidence of a pervasive sexualized environment. Representing Pte Benton's twin brother Tony and his sister Tracy Lewis, Liberty submitted an application to the Attorney General in July 2015, seeking to nullify the initial July 1995 inquest and demand a new investigation. Liberty stated that since Pte Benton's death, numerous individuals have informed his family and publicly asserted their belief that he, originally from Hastings, East Sussex, endured physical and psychological bullying at the barracks. Ms Lewis expressed being \"overwhelmed and disturbed by all the details of the shameful environment at Deepcut which have finally come to light through the Cheryl James inquest – it is terrible to think of Sean alone there.\" She added that over two decades after their brother's passing, and having recently lost both parents, she and Tony are \"determined to find out what happened to Sean.\" Pte Benton was the initial casualty among four young recruits who succumbed to gunshot wounds at Deepcut between 1995 and 2002. Liberty highlighted that the first inquest, held merely a month after his death, involved testimony from only six individuals. Crucially, Pte Benton's medical and mental health records were not procured, nor was any evidence gathered or presented regarding his experiences at the barracks. Emma Norton, a lawyer for Liberty, asserted that a proper and independent investigation into Pte Benton's death in 1995 could have spared his family decades of suffering and unresolved questions.", "label": "T4", "label_id": 3, "text_len_char": 2253, "text_len_word": 351}

Despite the clear poll outcome, the National Environment Research Council decided against naming its new £200 million polar research vessel RRS Boaty McBoatface.

This sparked widespread public anger and accusations that the NERC had disregarded the democratic will, leading to social media uproar over the perceived hypocrisy. Prof Wingham, while facing scrutiny, defended the NERC's stance, arguing a more dignified name was essential for a vessel undertaking critical polar and climate research. To appease the public, NERC announced a compromise: a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) on the RRS Sir David Attenborough would be named ‘Boaty McBoatface’.

The lack of clarity regarding Mr Ballmer's successor cast a shadow over an otherwise positive earnings report. Investors and analysts alike are keenly watching the search for the next chief executive, a decision that will profoundly shape Microsoft's future direction. Speculation has been rife, with names from both inside and outside the company being floated, including former Skype president Tony Bates and Ford CEO Alan Mulally, though Microsoft has remained tight-lipped about the process. The transition comes at a pivotal time for the Redmond-based software giant as it strives to redefine itself beyond its traditional Windows and Office strongholds. This \"devices and services\" push, championed by Steve Ballmer, represents a fundamental shift for Microsoft. It aims to integrate hardware and software more seamlessly, mirroring the successful strategies of competitors like Apple. However, the pivot has not been without its challenges. The reception to Windows 8, Microsoft's flagship operating system designed for touch-enabled devices, has been mixed since its launch, failing to significantly boost PC sales in a declining market. The acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division, a deal spearheaded by Mr Ballmer, is central to this strategy, promising Microsoft greater control over its smartphone ecosystem and a stronger competitive position in the mobile space. Analysts believe that the success of this transformation will largely depend on the new leadership's ability to execute on Ballmer's vision while also adapting to rapidly evolving consumer demands. The promised \"wide range\" of new products likely includes further iterations of the Surface tablet, potentially a smaller version, and new smartphones under the Nokia brand. The next generation Xbox console, though already launched, will also continue to be a key revenue driver. Despite the positive earnings, some analysts remain cautious, highlighting the intense competition in both the enterprise and consumer markets. The departing Mr Ballmer leaves behind a company in the midst of a massive strategic overhaul, and the next CEO will face the immense task of accelerating this transformation while simultaneously rekindling investor confidence and innovating at a pace previously unseen at Microsoft. The coming quarters will be critical in determining whether Microsoft can truly shed its legacy image and emerge as a dominant force in the mobile-first, cloud-first world.", "label": "T2", "label_id": 1, "text_len_char": 3235, "text_len_word": 515}

He added that their goal for this year is to draw twice as many visitors, encouraging the people of South Wales to appreciate this significant site and acknowledge the remarkable communities residing nearby.", "label": "T4", "label_id": 3, "text_len_char": 1007, "text_len_word": 155}

The guidelines were developed by industry and aviation safety experts and UAS operators . They provide comprehensive and clear guidance for safe and efficient UAS operations across the UK offshore energy sector. These guidelines cover critical areas such as operational planning, risk assessment, personnel competency, equipment standards, and emergency response procedures, aiming to standardize practices and significantly enhance overall safety. The increasing use of UAS offers substantial benefits for the industry, including improved safety by reducing the need for personnel in hazardous environments, cost efficiencies through faster data collection, and enhanced asset integrity management. Mick Borwell, Environment Director at OEUK, played a pivotal role in this collaborative effort. Mr. Borwell highlighted that these new guidelines are essential for integrating UAS technology responsibly and effectively into daily offshore tasks. He emphasized that the primary goal is to ensure that while the industry embraces technological advancements, safety remains paramount. The comprehensive nature of these guidelines will enable operators to maximize the advantages of UAS while adhering to robust safety standards, fostering best practices, and ensuring regulatory compliance within the UK's offshore sector.", "label": "T2", "label_id": 1, "text_len_char": 1470, "text_len_word": 208}

These guidelines were collaboratively created by specialists in industry, aviation safety, and UAS operation.

Mick Borwell, Oil and Gas UK's health, safety, and environment director, observed that while the number is currently small, more oil and gas operators are increasingly utilizing UAS primarily for inspections, but also for aerial photography, surveying, and security purposes. This technology is especially appealing due to its capacity to enhance safety. For instance, deploying unmanned aircraft for inspections in confined spaces instead of human personnel significantly mitigates risks, proving both effective and efficient. We anticipate their deployment will expand. Mr. Borwell stated that these new guidelines are intended to align with the existing safety and operational benchmarks already in place on the UK Continental Shelf for offshore oil and gas extraction and helicopter flight activities.

Defoe , 34 , has scored 11 goals in 21 appearances for the Premier League strugglers this season . His latest goals came on Monday as Sunderland twice fought from a goal deficit to draw 2-2 with Liverpool at the Stadium of Light. Defoe's two penalties highlighted his undiminished quality and vital importance to David Moyes' struggling side. Despite their precarious Premier League position, Sunderland are resolute in their stance that Defoe is not for sale. Moyes has repeatedly emphasized that losing their prolific scorer would severely jeopardise their survival hopes, particularly given how indispensable he has been to their attack. West Ham's pursuit, however, remains persistent. Manager Slaven Bilic is keen to secure a proven goalscorer, as the Hammers have suffered from inconsistent attacking performances and injuries this season. Bringing a player of Defoe's calibre and Premier League experience back to the London Stadium is seen as a key move to bolster their ambitions. The reported increased offer from the east London club is said to be around £6 million, but Sunderland are understood to value him considerably higher, closer to £10-12 million, reflecting his irreplaceable status. Defoe himself has maintained focus on his on-field commitments, embodying dedication to the Black Cats. His current priority is unequivocally keeping Sunderland in the top flight, a monumental task he has largely spearheaded. This transfer saga is expected to continue until the window closes, with West Ham anticipated to test Sunderland's resolve further, even as the Black Cats stand firm on their 'not for sale' position regarding their talisman.", "label": "T2", "label_id": 1, "text_len_char": 1769, "text_len_word": 279}
