Passing sentence earlier, judge Katharine Moore told Thrower he had been \"well-regarded\" by those he had helped, adding he had been a listening ear \"in times of great sadness and some in happier times\". She told him: \"It seems to me that there has been a tendency throughout to attribute this persistent behaviour over a two-year period to a breakdown in your mental health. \"I accept without reservation that you were working very hard. \"I do not accept that your actions here though were anything other than an exercise of free choice repeated again and again when you thought you could get away with it in public lavatories.\" When Thrower was arrested, officers found three further videos recorded on the phone that day, including of two men who had not noticed they were being filmed. Thrower, of Church Street, Hadleigh, Suffolk, is rector of Hadleigh, Layham and Shelley. He has been suspended from all roles by the Diocese of St Edmundsbury in Ipswich.

Thrower was arrested at a shopping centre in Ipswich in August 2016 . He admitted two counts of voyeurism at a previous hearing and his sentence was suspended for 24 months . Thrower was ordered to complete a 60 - day rehabilitation activity requirement, aimed at addressing his offending behaviour and preventing re-offending. As part of his sentence, he was also made the subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) for five years. This order imposes strict conditions, including restrictions on his use of internet-enabled devices and a prohibition on entering any public lavatories. Furthermore, Thrower was ordered to pay £2,500 in prosecution costs and a victim surcharge. The court heard details of how the Very Reverend Martin Thrower, who had served as the rector of Hadleigh in Suffolk for 15 years, had committed these offences. His reprehensible actions came to light when he was observed acting suspiciously at a shopping centre in Ipswich, specifically in the men's public toilets, leading to his arrest in August 2016. During the sentencing hearing at Norwich Crown Court, the presiding judge highlighted the profound breach of trust involved in Thrower's conduct, given his prominent and respected role within the Church of England and the local Hadleigh community. While acknowledging Thrower's early admission of guilt and expressions of remorse, the judge unequivocally underscored the seriousness of the voyeurism offences and the distress caused to his victims. The court took into account his previous good character and long service to the church as mitigating factors, which were instrumental in the decision to suspend his prison sentence for 24 months, but firmly emphasized the necessity for both punitive measures and active rehabilitation. This high-profile case sent ripples through the Hadleigh community and the wider diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich, raising questions about accountability and the profound impact of such a conviction on a figure once held in high esteem.", "label": "T2", "label_id": 1, "text_len_char": 2171, "text_len_word": 346}

The Briton has denied he is a homophobe and claimed he is \" uniting the world \" This upcoming meeting with the British Boxing Board of Control is expected to be a crucial one, as the organization seeks to address the widespread condemnation sparked by the boxer’s controversial remarks. Public outcry intensified following comments where Fury equated homosexuality and abortion with the end of the world, and made disparaging remarks about women. The firestorm led to significant pressure. Over 140,000 people signed an online petition calling for the Briton to be removed from the BBC Sports Personality of the Year shortlist. Despite the controversy, the BBC maintained Fury would remain on the list, citing that the decision was based on sporting achievement. This stance further fueled debate about the responsibility of public figures. Furthermore, his comments prompted an investigation by Greater Manchester Police (GMP). The police force confirmed they had received complaints regarding his comments, which were being assessed for potential hate crime implications. While the GMP later clarified no specific crime had been recorded, the police inquiry underscored the seriousness with which his remarks were viewed. Fury, who secured his world titles after defeating Wladimir Klitschko, has consistently maintained that his comments were taken out of context and that he is not a prejudiced individual, insisting he respects all people. Despite his defence, the ongoing controversy has cast a significant shadow over his boxing achievements and raised uncomfortable questions for the sport.

Members attend events across the UK dressed in \"movie-accurate\" costumes to raise funds for charity. But Mr Broomhall had to make some modifications to his outfit to make it move more freely on the ascents and descents of Snowdon and Ben Nevis, which were done this summer. For safety reasons, he wore walking boots because his costume footwear was not suitable for the terrain involved and was accompanied by friends. Dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper and carrying a UK Garrison flag, Mr Broomhall said he drew more than his fair share of funny looks tackling Ben Nevis, Scotland highest Munro and Britain's tallest mountain. He said: \"We had been confusing a lot of other climbers along the way as a stormtrooper was the last thing they had been expecting to see climbing Ben Nevis. \"We handed out cards and told them my tale and they offered nothing but the most vocal support.\" Mr Broomhall also received donations from other walkers. Higher up Ben Nevis he had to negotiate thigh-deep snow. At the first of these snowfields there was some light relief when he and his walking companion had a snowball fight with other walkers. Mr Broomhall said: \"The last snowfield held the summit and, with my heart swelling with pride, I let the flag fly and charged on to the summit. \"We had made it. It was brilliant and I was so happy at making it after all the struggles and rallying needed to get myself there. \"I was greeted by a cheer from the climbers there and planted the flag on the summit itself claiming it for the Empire.\" He added: \"I love Scotland and I love Munros and this was a challenge that I enjoyed doing. \"Scafell Pike is next.

He was inspired to take on the gruelling challenge after seeing the devastating impact of cancer on close friends and family members. He believes that every step he takes, and every pound he raises, contributes to vital research that could save lives in the future. His ascent of Snowdon, the highest peak in Wales, provided a challenging start to his mountaineering endeavours, offering stunning views of Snowdonia National Park despite periods of cloud and wind. The subsequent climb of Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain, proved to be an even more demanding test of his physical and mental fortitude. He recounted battling the notoriously unpredictable Scottish weather conditions, which ranged from clear spells to biting winds and snow flurries, even in what is considered late spring. The impromptu snowball fight on Ben Nevis's upper slopes offered a brief, memorable moment of camaraderie and fun amidst the arduous trek, highlighting the shared spirit among those conquering the formidable peak near Fort William. The descent, often as challenging as the ascent, required intense concentration and resilience, but the thought of the critical cause kept him focused. With two of the UK's three highest peaks now conquered, Mr Broomhall is eagerly anticipating his final challenge: Scafell Pike in the Lake District. Completing Scafell Pike will mark the culmination of his personal 'Three Peaks Challenge', an iconic feat that involves climbing the highest mountains in Scotland, England, and Wales within a set period. He understands that while Scafell Pike is the lowest of the three, it presents its own unique difficulties, including rugged terrain and potentially tricky navigation, especially if weather conditions are poor. Ashley Broomhall has set a fundraising target of £1,500 for Cancer Research UK and has already made significant progress towards that goal, having raised over £900 through a combination of online donations and sponsorship from friends, family, and local businesses. He expressed immense gratitude for the generosity shown by his supporters so far. \"The support I've received has been overwhelming,\" said Mr Broomhall. \"Knowing that people are backing me and contributing to such an important cause really motivates me to keep going, even when the climbs get tough. Every single donation helps fund groundbreaking research into new treatments and ultimately, a cure.\" He hopes that by sharing his journey, he can encourage more people to donate or consider their own fundraising challenges. Donations to Ashley Broomhall's efforts can be made via his dedicated JustGiving page, which can be found by searching for his name or his specific challenge details online.

Mr Hosie's demand for \"absolute transparency\" highlights the need for stringent oversight. He questioned the ¬£10m outlay, despite projected ¬£775,000 annual savings, demanding meticulous scrutiny of long-term value. The refit, involving interior modifications for VIP transport, has drawn criticism. Proponents, however, argue an RAF Voyager A330 offers superior security, flexibility, and availability for ministerial and PM travel over commercial charters. The government's justification rests on long-term economic benefits and enhanced operational independence. The ¬£10m investment is projected to be recovered via savings in approximately 13 years. Utilizing an existing military asset, rather than chartering private jets, streamlines logistics for sensitive missions. This RAF Voyager A330, primarily a refueller, gains invaluable dual-use capability, maximizing its efficiency within the defence budget. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson emphasized this project delivers excellent value. The conversion allows the aircraft to maintain core military duties when not needed for VIP transport, preventing the expense of a dedicated executive jet. This multi-role approach is central to an efficient defence estate. Acknowledging the SNP's valid concerns, particularly Stewart Hosie's, the government pledged full disclosure on costs and progress. This aims to dispel \"vanity project\" perceptions and reaffirm fiscal prudence. Ultimately, the goal is to provide the PM and senior officials with secure, cost-effective travel, seamlessly integrating it with existing military assets. This ensures the RAF Voyager A330 remains a cornerstone for national security and state affairs.", "label": "T2", "label_id": 1, "text_len_char": 2384, "text_len_word": 359}

This adaptation is projected to save approximately £775,000 annually, as the plane will be a more economical alternative to chartering flights. Stewart Hosie of the SNP stressed the necessity of \"absolute transparency\" to ensure taxpayers receive the \"best deal.\" He also pointed out the announcement's timing, just a week before a spending review expected to unveil more \"Tory cuts\" that are already severely affecting the public. Indeed, most government departments are facing budget reductions of at least 25% over the next four years. A source indicated that the Prime Minister's current flights, whether on Royal Squadron planes or long-haul charters, cost an average of £6,700 per flying hour. In contrast, the adapted RAF aircraft would cost around £2,000 per hour and would still be available for refuelling when not in use for transport. The Royal family would also have access to this aircraft. This move echoes a previous plan by Tony Blair to purchase two private jets, controversially nicknamed \"Blair Force One\" after the US President's plane, which was subsequently cancelled by his successor, Gordon Brown. Further details about these new arrangements are expected during Monday's strategic defence and security review. While no definitive in-service date for the plane has been set, it could become operational as early as next year. A government spokesperson elaborated that as part of the defence review, they have been investigating how to better utilize the RAF fleet for ministerial transport and achieve taxpayer savings. They confirmed the decision to adapt an existing Voyager, allowing it to transport ministers and be available to the Royal family, in addition to its primary air refuelling role.", "label": "T4", "label_id": 3, "text_len_char": 1845, "text_len_word": 288}

Dearden , who was dropped on one , survived a couple of run - out chances in his lengthy vigil of 145 runs, an innings that anchored Leicestershire's first innings and set a challenging total for Glamorgan. His century, a testament to his resilience and growing maturity, included 18 fours and two sixes, played across more than five hours at the crease. It was an innings of two halves, patiently accumulating runs against the new ball before accelerating with Mark Pettini in a partnership that put the visitors on the back foot. The early scares, being dropped and almost run out, only seemed to steel his resolve, as he focused on building a substantial total for his team. His dismissal by Andrew Salter, a rare lapse in concentration, came from a ball that spun sharply back into him, ending a truly memorable individual performance. With Dearden gone, Leicestershire still needed to consolidate. Mark Pettini, who had played an excellent supporting role, then took on the mantle of primary aggressor. He found an able partner in Ned Eckersley, and the pair continued to build on the platform Dearden had established. Glamorgan, despite their earlier breakthroughs, found it difficult to dislodge Pettini, whose experience shone through. Lukas Carey, though expensive in patches, continued to pose a threat with his pace and bounce, while Andrew Salter tried to tie down the scoring with his accurate left-arm spin. The Welsh county's bowlers, however, struggled to maintain consistent pressure as the pitch flattened out under the floodlights. Pettini reached his own well-deserved hundred just before the close of play, guiding Leicestershire past the 400-run mark. They declared their innings at 415 for 7, giving their bowlers a brief spell at Glamorgan's openers before stumps. The declaration was a clear statement of intent, aiming to put Glamorgan under pressure immediately. Glamorgan faced a tricky 10-over period under lights, which proved challenging. Sam Northeast and Nick Selman weathered the initial storm, but the Foxes' new ball bowlers, led by Chris Wright, made them play at everything. Glamorgan ended the day on 28 for 1, having lost Selman cheaply, caught at slip off a superb delivery from Gavin Griffiths. Northeast (15 not out) and Marnus Labuschagne (8 not out) will resume tomorrow, with Glamorgan still trailing by a substantial 387 runs. The match remains finely poised, with Leicestershire holding a clear advantage due to Dearden's heroics and Pettini's late flourish, but Glamorgan will be hoping their strong batting line-up can respond on what appears to be a good batting surface.

Under the floodlights, Pettini then guided the Foxes to secure their second batting point. Despite being dropped when he had just one run and narrowly escaping two potential run-outs, Dearden’s resilient vigil lasted 211 balls. This was a gritty batting display from the home side, who were asked to bat first in a contest between two teams that had both suffered significant defeats in their opening two fixtures. Salter secured his second wicket, bowling Cameron Delport for 20, after which Pettini and Lewis Hill rapidly added 73 runs, capitalising on the new ball. Speaking to BBC Radio Leicester, Leicestershire’s Harry Dearden commented: \"I'm incredibly proud of achieving my career-best score. While I had hoped to reach a century, I'm still very proud of this performance, which has made it a truly positive day for us. The conditions were challenging early on, with the ball moving off the pitch and swinging. The key was to face as many deliveries as possible to settle in, and it was a tough contest against their opening bowlers. My focus was on digging deep and maintaining maximum discipline. Batting with Horts (Paul Horton) is beneficial as his experience provides a calming influence, and it's also excellent to bat alongside Mark (Pettini) because he helps you stay balanced.\" Glamorgan spinner Andrew Salter shared his thoughts with BBC Wales Sport: \"I'm pleased to have taken those two wickets, though it wasn't surprising that there wasn't much spin – one delivery went straight through, and the other, a bit fuller, found some rough. My primary aim was to control the scoring rate, believing that sustained pressure would eventually yield rewards. Therefore, I hope my services won't be required significantly more in this first innings.

Taylor, known for his explosive power and intelligent boxing, wasted no time in asserting his dominance. He moved fluidly, cutting off the ring and landing sharp, accurate jabs that quickly reddened Mate’s face. The Edinburgh crowd, already buzzing with anticipation, roared with every connection. Taylor’s southpaw stance and powerful left hand proved particularly problematic for the Hungarian, who struggled to find his rhythm or land anything significant in return. Within the first minute, a blistering combination from Taylor – a left hook followed by a straight right – sent Mate stumbling backward into the ropes. The Commonwealth gold medallist, sensing an early finish, pressed home his advantage with relentless aggression. Mate showed commendable resilience, trying to clinch and weather the storm, but Taylor's precision and volume of punches were overwhelming. Just past the midway point of the opening round, a perfectly timed left uppercut from Taylor snapped Mate’s head back, followed by a crunching right hook that sent the visitor to the canvas. The referee immediately began his count as Mate struggled to regain his footing, his eyes glazed. Although he managed to clamber upright at the count of nine, his legs were clearly unsteady, and the referee wisely waved off the contest, deeming him unable to continue. The official time of the stoppage was just 2 minutes and 10 seconds of the first round, a truly emphatic and devastating performance from the Prestonpans pugilist. The packed Meadowbank Arena erupted in a deafening roar, a standing ovation for their hometown hero. After the fight, a beaming Taylor soaked in the adulation of the crowd, acknowledging their support. Speaking to BBC Scotland later, he reflected on the win, reiterating his surprise at the swiftness of the victory. \"I came here expecting a tough fight, maybe a few rounds to get warmed up, but I caught him clean early and just went for it. The support from the fans was incredible, it really spurred me on.\" Manager Barry McGuigan, the legendary former world champion, watched on with immense satisfaction. \"Josh showed tonight exactly why we believe he's destined for greatness,\" McGuigan told reporters. \"His power, his speed, his ring intelligence – it's all there.

Four men received sentences of between 18 and 30 years in jail This tragic incident, which unfolded on June 15, 2012, at the Campos Morumbi estate in Curuguaty, became widely known as the Curuguaty Massacre. The land in question was fiercely disputed, with landless farmers claiming it as state property intended for agrarian reform. The subsequent judicial process was highly controversial; human rights organizations and international observers heavily criticized the trial of the eleven farmers, alleging a lack of due process and insufficient evidence linking them to the police deaths. The massacre provided the immediate catalyst for the Paraguayan congress to orchestrate a rapid impeachment of President Fernando Lugo. His swift removal, days after the killings, was seen as a politically motivated move to reverse his land reform agenda. Several regional governments, including MERCOSUR and UNASUR, condemned Lugo's ouster as a 'parliamentary coup,' leading to Paraguay's temporary suspension from these blocs. Despite the initial convictions handed down in 2016, a major turning point occurred in July 2017. The Supreme Court of Justice of Paraguay annulled the sentences against the eleven convicted farmers, including the four, citing a lack of concrete evidence and procedural errors. This landmark decision led to their immediate release, marking a complex legal saga that underscored the deep-seated land conflicts and political polarization in Paraguay.

Despite efforts to rebrand and reposition the stores as ‘My Local’, aiming for a community-focused offering, the chain failed to gain significant traction or achieve sustainable profitability. The decision to appoint KPMG as administrators came after a period of intense financial pressure, leaving no viable path forward without significant restructuring. KPMG's immediate priority has been to manage the closure of the 93 unprofitable stores and to seek buyers for the remaining 32. Sources close to the administration process indicate that finding a single buyer for the remaining portfolio might be challenging, suggesting that individual or smaller clusters of stores could be sold off to other retailers or convenience store operators. The closure process will unfortunately result in the loss of a significant number of the 1,658 jobs, though Morrisons' proactive offer to re-employ former My Local staff, where possible, provides some relief to those affected. This gesture by Morrisons highlights its ongoing commitment, having initially established the convenience arm and then divested it. The collapse of My Local underscores the difficulties even established players face in the convenience sector. For Greybull Capital, this represents a significant setback, adding to their mixed portfolio of investments. The future of the remaining 32 stores hinges entirely on KPMG’s ability to secure buyers within a reasonable timeframe, failing which, they too will inevitably shut, marking the complete disappearance of the My Local brand from the high street, less than a year after its high-profile launch under Greybull.", "label": "T2", "label_id": 1, "text_len_char": 2930, "text_len_word": 452}

The remaining outlets will stay open while KPMG, the appointed administrator, seeks potential buyers. Should these efforts fail, those stores too will cease operations. The company had a workforce of 1,658 individuals. Morrisons, a supermarket chain, sold My Local to Greybull Capital last year and has since committed to offering positions to former My Local employees. The retailer found it difficult to compete in the fiercely competitive and price-war-ridden grocery market. Formerly known as Morrisons' M Local, My Local was acquired by Greybull for £25 million. This acquisition was spearheaded by Mike Greene, an experienced figure in retail who gained public recognition from his appearance on Channel 4's The Secret Millionaire. My Local had indicated earlier this month that administrators were alerted to assume control of the business. Just last week, Morrisons extended a helping hand to My Local's staff, proposing job opportunities within its own supermarkets in the event of store closures. Mike Greene expressed his regret, stating that the past nine months constituted \"one of the toughest retail trading periods\" he had ever encountered, with My Local confronting \"intense competition.\" He added that the management team was \"unable to return the business to profitability,\" for which he was \"truly sorry.\" Mark Orton, a partner at KPMG and joint administrator, commented that the management faced \"tough trading conditions,\" and despite their \"best efforts to improve performance,\" My Local ultimately \"was unable to return to viability.\" He confirmed that while most stores have now ceased operations, KPMG is engaged in \"active discussions with a number of interested parties\" regarding both the 32 remaining operational premises and a select few that have already shut down. My Local's collapse highlights a challenging period for the retail industry, coming after the bankruptcies of BHS and Austin Reed. Furthermore, on Tuesday, the owners of Store Twenty One, a fashion retailer, announced plans for a restructuring that could lead to store closures and job cuts.", "label": "T4", "label_id": 3, "text_len_char": 2162, "text_len_word": 334}

For the 'Leave' campaign to succeed, it requires absolute clarity of purpose, a laser-like focus on the core arguments for sovereignty and economic opportunity, and above all, a cohesive and disciplined leadership that speaks with one voice. It needs to be perceived by the public as a unified force, not a collection of warring factions. It is my earnest hope that by removing myself from the immediate leadership structure, it may create an opportunity for a renewed focus on unity and strategic coherence. My commitment to seeing Britain leave the European Union remains absolute, and I will continue to support the broader 'Leave' cause from outside this specific leadership role.

Hayley Murdoch , 29 , and Sheila Dixon , 71 , both from Carlisle , died following the collision at Newby Cross in 2016 . Dr Laura Duffy called Logan , years after that harrowing day, to marvel at his incredible journey back to health. She vividly recalled the scene at Newby Cross, describing it as one of the most challenging she had ever encountered. Logan had been clinically dead, but through the swift, coordinated efforts of the emergency services – the first responders, paramedics, and the air ambulance crew – he was resuscitated at the roadside. He was then airlifted to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle in a critical condition, placed in an induced coma, and remained there for several weeks, fighting for his life. His family, already reeling from the devastating loss of Hayley Murdoch and Sheila Dixon, braced themselves for the worst, enduring agonizing days and nights by his bedside. Against all odds, Logan began a slow, arduous recovery. Dr Duffy recounted the initial prognosis, which had been bleak, suggesting severe brain damage and long-term disability were highly probable. Yet, Logan’s resilience and determination, coupled with exceptional medical care, defied these expectations. His rehabilitation was extensive, involving months of physiotherapy, speech therapy, and psychological support to help him come to terms with the traumatic event and the profound grief of losing his mother and grandmother. The call from Dr Duffy was a poignant reminder of how close he came to joining them. She told him that his survival was nothing short of miraculous, a testament to the life-saving work done in those critical moments at the crash site near Carlisle. Logan, now a vocal advocate for the Great North Air Ambulance, often reflects on that day, acknowledging that without their rapid response, he would not be here today to share his story or remember his beloved Hayley Murdoch and Sheila Dixon. The scars, both physical and emotional, remain, but so does an immense gratitude for the second chance at life he received.", "label": "T2", "label_id": 1, "text_len_char": 2180, "text_len_word": 357}

Police said the suspects were part of a transatlantic drugs ring run by the ' Ndrangheta a powerful organized crime syndicate based in Calabria, southern Italy. This operation highlights the growing partnership between Colombian drug producers, particularly remnant factions associated with the dissolved Farc insurgency, and the sophisticated distribution networks of European mafias. Investigators revealed that the cocaine shipments originated in remote jungle labs in Colombia, often in areas previously controlled by the Farc, who either directly cultivated coca or levied 'taxes' on independent producers for safe passage and processing. The sailing boats were chosen for their ability to blend in with legitimate maritime traffic, making them less conspicuous than large cargo vessels, and for their capacity to carry substantial loads without attracting undue attention. The routes typically involved crossing the Atlantic, often utilizing strategically located island nations as re-provisioning points before reaching European ports, predominantly in Spain and Portugal, for onward distribution across the continent. This particular bust involved meticulous intelligence gathering over several years, a collaborative effort spanning multiple law enforcement agencies. A significant breakthrough came with intelligence shared by The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which had been tracking the cartel's activities and its nexus with various Colombian narco-trafficking groups. Authorities in Colombia and Italy, alongside Europol and other European police forces, executed synchronized raids following the DEA's lead. Among the arrests were key logistical managers in Europe and several suppliers in South America. The Farc commander arrested in Colombia was reportedly a crucial link, responsible for ensuring the quality and quantity of the cocaine supplied and facilitating its transport to coastal rendezvous points. Further investigations are underway in the region, including in areas near Santa Fe, where some of the preliminary processing and logistics for the illicit drug trade are suspected to have taken place, demonstrating the intricate web of this criminal enterprise.

Despite their spirited efforts, Wolves struggled to find a way past Burnley's resolute defence, marshalled expertly by Ben Mee. The home side, buoyed by Rodriguez's brace, controlled much of the possession in the midfield, with Trippier continuing to be a menace down the right flank, his delivery a constant threat. Burnley’s dominance was evident, and they continued to press for a third goal to put the game beyond doubt. Scott Arfield and George Boyd worked tirelessly on the wings, creating space for the full-backs to push forward. Trippier, in particular, seemed to be enjoying one of his most influential performances of the season, his crosses causing panic in the Wolves penalty area time and again. However, Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme pulled off several key saves to deny Burnley further additions to the scoreline, including a superb stop from a fierce Rodriguez volley that would have completed his hat-trick. As the game wore on, Wolves pushed higher, desperate to find a goal that would reignite their hopes. Garath McCleary, who had been involved in the early penalty incident, tried to make amends with some penetrating runs, but his efforts were largely isolated. Burnley’s backline, with Mee at its heart, stood firm against the late pressure. Manager Sean Dyche made tactical substitutions to shore up the midfield and defence, bringing on fresh legs to maintain their high work rate. The final whistle blew with Burnley securing a comfortable 2-0 victory, a result that reflected their superior attacking prowess and defensive solidity. Rodriguez's clinical finishing, combined with Kieran Trippier's exceptional service, proved to be the decisive factors in a commanding performance by the Clarets.

The origin of its unrusted iron blade has baffled scientists because such metalwork was rare in ancient Egypt. Tutankhamun was mummified more than 3,300 years ago. Italian and Egyptian researchers used \"a non-invasive X-ray technique\" to confirm the composition of the iron without damaging it, according to a study published in the journal of Meteoritics and Planetary Science.

They compared the composition of the dagger to known meteorites within 2,000km around the Red Sea coast of Egypt, and found that one in particular - which landed 150 miles (240km) west of Alexandria - contained similar levels of nickel and cobalt. Ancient Egyptians attached great significance to meteoritic iron for the production of fine ornamental or ceremonial objects, the researchers say. \"They were aware that these rare chunks of iron fell from the sky already in the 13th [Century] BCE, anticipating Western culture by more than two millennia,\" they write in their findings. The high manufacturing quality of the blade in comparison with other simple-shaped meteoritic iron artefacts \"suggests a significant mastery of ironworking in Tutankhamun's time\", they say.

Italian and Egyptian researchers used \" a non - invasive X - ray technique \" to confirm that the iron blade was indeed of extraterrestrial origin, likely from a meteorite. The study, published in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science, analyzed the blade's elemental composition, revealing high levels of nickel and cobalt, elements typically found in iron meteorites but rare in terrestrial iron. This groundbreaking finding provided a definitive answer to a long-standing archaeological mystery that had puzzled experts since Howard Carter’s initial discovery of the dagger in Tutankhamun's tomb. The sophisticated X-ray fluorescence analysis, conducted by researchers from the Polytechnic University of Milan and the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, eliminated any doubt about the blade's celestial source. The presence of nickel, in particular, was a key indicator, as iron extracted from ores on Earth rarely contains such high concentrations. This suggests that ancient Egyptian metallurgists, despite their advanced skills in working with gold and copper, utilized this unique, readily available raw material from the sky. The fact that the dagger has remained largely uncorroded for over three millennia further supports its meteoric origin, as meteoric iron is often more resistant to rust due to its unique crystalline structure and composition. This discovery sheds new light on the technological capabilities and available resources in ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period. It implies that the Egyptians were not only aware of falling 'sky-iron' but also possessed the skills to forge it into intricate objects of immense value, fit for a pharaoh like Tutankhamun. The cultural significance of such a material, literally descended from the heavens, would have been profound, adding to the mystique and power attributed to the young king. The other dagger found alongside it was made of gold, contrasting sharply with the 'celestial' iron one, highlighting the distinct and perhaps revered nature of the iron blade. This research emphasizes the interdisciplinary approach needed to unravel the secrets of ancient civilizations, combining archaeology, art history, and modern scientific analysis to provide unprecedented insights into the past of Tut and his people.", "label": "T2", "label_id": 1, "text_len_char": 2598, "text_len_word": 396}

The pristine, uncorroded iron blade's source remained a puzzle for researchers, as iron metallurgy was uncommon in ancient Egypt. Tutankhamun's mummification occurred over 3,300 years ago. A collaborative study by Italian and Egyptian researchers, published in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science, utilized a non-destructive X-ray method to verify the iron's makeup without causing harm. Daniela Comelli, the study's lead author, stated that \"a significant nickel content unequivocally points to meteoritic iron.\" The team proposed that the combined levels of iron, nickel, and cobalt \"strongly suggest an extraterrestrial origin\" for the metal. By comparing the dagger's composition to known meteorites found within 2,000 km of Egypt's Red Sea coast, they identified one specific meteorite – which struck 150 miles (240 km) west of Alexandria – that exhibited comparable nickel and cobalt concentrations. According to the researchers, ancient Egyptians highly valued meteoritic iron, frequently using it for crafting exquisite ornamental or ceremonial items. Their findings indicate that Egyptians in the 13th century BCE already recognized that these unusual iron fragments descended from the heavens, a realization that predated Western understanding by over two millennia. The blade's superior craftsmanship, especially when contrasted with simpler meteoritic iron artifacts, \"implies a remarkable proficiency in ironworking during Tutankhamun's reign,\" the team noted. This ornate dagger, boasting a decorated gold handle and a gold sheath adorned with a floral lily design on one face and a feather pattern on the other, is presently exhibited at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.", "label": "T4", "label_id": 3, "text_len_char": 1848, "text_len_word": 269}
